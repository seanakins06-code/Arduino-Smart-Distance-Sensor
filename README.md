This project is used to measure objects' distances and activate a buzzer at a certain distance.
I have added a buzzer and it is coded so it will work at certain levels. 
This will change with the variance of distance. 
The outputs will be displayed on a LCD screen; Level of the buzzer and distance anyway from sensor.
